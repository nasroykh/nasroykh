# Hey, I'm Nas 👋

**Software Engineer** specializing in **AI/LLM integration** and **enterprise systems (Frappe/ERPNext)**.

I build web applications that solve real business problems — from RAG systems and AI-powered tools to full ERP implementations. I ask "what does the business need right now?" before writing a single line of code.
